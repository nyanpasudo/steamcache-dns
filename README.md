# Steam Cache Docker Container

## Introduction

This docker container provides DNS entries for caching services to be used in conjunction with a steamcache/steamcache & steamcache/generic server.

The DNS is generated automatically at startup of the container, the list of supported services is available here: https://github.com/uklans/cache-domains

The primary use case is gaming events, such as LAN parties, which need to be able to cope with hundreds or thousands of computers receiving an unannounced patch - without spending a fortune on internet connectivity. Other uses include smaller networks, such as Internet Cafes and home networks, where the new games are regularly installed on multiple computers; or multiple independent operating systems on the same computer.

## Quick Explanation

For a LAN cache to function on your network you need two services.
* A depot cache service
* A special DNS service

The depot cache service transparently proxies your requests for content to Steam/Origin/Etc, or serves the content to you if it already has it.

The special DNS service handles DNS queries normally (recursively), except when they're about a cached service and in that case it responds that the depot cache service should be used.

## Usage

If all of the services you wish to run point to a single IP address, you should make sure you set USE_GENERIC_CACHE=true and set LANCACHE_IP to the IP address of the caching server.
In this case it is highly recommended that you use some form of load balancer or reverse proxy, as running a single caching server for multiple services will result in cache clashes and will result in incorrect or corrupt data.

Run the steamcache-dns container using the following to allow UDP port 53 (DNS) through the host machine:

```
docker run --name steamcache-dns -p 10.0.0.2:53:53/udp -e USE_GENERIC_CACHE=true -e LANCACHE_IP=10.0.0.3 steamcache/steamcache-dns:latest
```

You can specify a different IP for each service hosted within the cache for a full list os supported services have a look at https://github.com/uklans/cache-domains. Set the IP for a service using ${SERVICE}CACHE_IP environment:
```
LANCACHE_IP (requires USE_GENERIC_CACHE to be set to true)

BLIZZARDCACHE_IP
FRONTIERCACHE_IP
ORIGINCACHE_IP
RIOTCACHE_IP
STEAMCACHE_IP
UPLAYCACHE_IP
```

You can also disable any of the cache dns resolvers by setting the environment variable of DISABLE_${SERVICE}=true
```
DISABLE_BLIZZARD
DISABLE_RIOT
DISABLE_UPLAY

```

To use a custom upstream DNS server, use the `UPSTREAM_DNS` variable:

```
docker run --name steamcache-dns -p 10.0.0.2:53:53/udp -e STEAMCACHE_IP=10.0.0.3 -e UPSTREAM_DNS=8.8.8.8 steamcache/steamcache-dns:latest
```

This will add a forwarder for all queries not served by steamcache to be sent to the upstream DNS server, in this case Google's DNS.  If
you have a DNS server on 1.2.3.4, the command argument would be `-e UPSTREAM_DNS=1.2.3.4`.

## Multiple IPs

Should you wish a cache server to have multiple IP addresses (for example a monolithic instance tuned for steam) you may specify them as a space delimited list within quotes for example: `-e STEAMCACHE_IP="1.2.3.4 5.6.7.8"`

## Running on Startup

Follow the instructions in the Docker documentation to run the container at startup.
